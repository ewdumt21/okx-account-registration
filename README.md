This takes you directly to the signup form where you'll begin creating your account.

## Step 2: Enter Your Email Address

Type your email address into the designated Email field. Make sure it's an email you regularly checkâ€”OKX will use this to send you verification codes and important account updates.

Don't worry about making it fancy. Just use whichever email feels most convenient.

## Step 3: Click the Register Button

Once you've entered your email, hit the "Register" button. This kicks off the verification process.

The platform will immediately send a verification code to your inboxâ€”so keep that email tab handy.

## Step 4: Check Your Email for Verification Code

Head over to your email inbox and look for a message from OKX. Inside, you'll find a six-digit verification code that was automatically generated for you.

This code is time-sensitive, so grab it quickly and move to the next step.

## Step 5: Enter the Verification Code

You've got 10 minutes to enter that six-digit code into the "Enter code" field back on the OKX page. Once you've typed it in, click "Next" to proceed.

If the code expires, no big dealâ€”just request a new one.

## Step 6: Create a Strong Password

Now comes the important part: securing your account. Enter a password in the Password field that you'll use to protect your account going forward. When you're satisfied with your choice, click "Next."

Here's what makes a solid password:

- Mix numbers, letters, symbols, and both uppercase and lowercase characters
- Follow cryptocurrency security best practicesâ€”treat this like your bank account
- Never share your password with anyone, even if they claim to work for OKX

Think of your password as the lock on your crypto vault. Make it strong.

## Step 7: Choose Your Next Move

Congratulations! You now have access to your OKX account dashboard. From here, you have two main options to get started:

- **Buy with Card**: Purchase Bitcoin and over 99 other cryptocurrencies using 92 different fiat currencies. Perfect if you're starting from scratch.
- **Deposit**: If you already own crypto, you can transfer funds from another platform or wallet directly into your OKX account.
